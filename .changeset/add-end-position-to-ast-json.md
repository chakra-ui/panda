Add `endLineNumber` and `endColumn` fields to AST JSON output from `panda debug` command.

The `*.ast.json` files generated by `panda debug` now include complete position information for detected CSS usage locations. Previously, only start position (`line` and `column`) was exported. Now the output includes:

- `line`: Start line number
- `column`: Start column number
- `endLineNumber`: End line number (new)
- `endColumn`: End column number (new)

This provides complete span coverage for each detected node, making it easier to precisely locate CSS usage in source files.

Fixes #3407
