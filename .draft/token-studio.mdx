# Token Studio

Panda provide built-in documentation for tokens defined in your project. This will be useful for your team to
communicate design decisions in your own way, and share information effectively.

> **Good to know:** The Panda Studio is a React application built with Astro

To launch the Panda studio, run the following command:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm panda studio
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm panda studio
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn panda studio
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun panda studio
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This will launch a local server on port 3000. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/tokens` to view the documentation.

## Deployment

To build the Panda Studio, run the following command:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm panda studio --build
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm panda studio --build
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn panda studio --build
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    bun panda studio --build
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

This will create a `panda-static` folder in the root of your project. You can deploy this folder to any static site host
like Vercel or Netlify.

## Token Analyzer

When you run the Panda Studio, it will scan your project for tokens and generate a JSON report that you can then interactivily explore in the Studio's Token analyzer page.

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/token-analyzer` to explore the report.

> You can also generate and inspect that JSON report using the CLI [`analyze`](docs/references/cli.mdx#panda-analyze) command

In the Token analyzer page, you can:

- See how many tokens are used in your project, sort them, and search them by property name, category, file path or value...
- Look at a visual color palette from your most used colors
- Inspect a token and see where and how it is used in your project
- Open the exact line where a token is defined in your preferred code editor
- Scope tokens & colors used by files
