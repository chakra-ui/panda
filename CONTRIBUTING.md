Thanks for showing interest to contribute to Panda CSS ðŸ’–, you rock!

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all of which are valuable. Here's a few
guidelines that should help you as you prepare your contribution.

## Setup the Project

The following steps will get you up and running to contribute to Panda CSS:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of [this page](https://github.com/chakra-ui/panda))

2. Clone your fork locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/panda.git
cd panda
```

3. Setup all the dependencies and packages by running `pnpm install`. This command will install dependencies.

> If you run into any issues during this step, kindly reach out to the Panda CSS team here:

## Development

To improve our development process, we've set up tooling and systems. Panda CSS uses a monorepo structure with the
followin structure:

### Directory Structure

| Package                                       | Description                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| [cli](packages/cli)                           | CLI package installed by the end user                       |
| [core](packages/core)                         | Contains core features of Panda (utility, recipes, etc)     |
| [config](packages/config)                     | Contains functions for reading and merging the panda config |
| [extractor](packages/extractor)               | Contains code for fast AST parsing and scanning             |
| [generator](packages/generator)               | Contains codegen artifacts (js, css, jsx)                   |
| [parser](packages/parser)                     | Contains code for parsing a source code                     |
| [is-valid-prop](packages/is-valid-prop)       | Contains code for checking if a prop is a valid css prop    |
| [node](packages/node)                         | Contains the Node.js API of Panda's features                |
| [token-dictionary](packages/token-dictionary) | Contains code used to process tokens and semantic tokens    |
| [shared](packages/shared)                     | Contains shared TS                                          |

### Tooling

- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/) to manage packages and dependencies
- [Tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/) to bundle packages
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing, mostly using snapshots
- [Changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) for changes documentation, changelog generation, and release
  management.

### Commands

**`pnpm install`**: bootstraps the entire project, symlinks all dependencies for cross-component development and builds
all components.

**`pnpm dev`**: starts tsup with watch mode for all packages.

**`pnpm build`**: run build for all packages.

**`pnpm test`**: run test for all packages.

**`pnpm release`**: publish changed packages.

## Think you found a bug?

Please conform to the issue template and provide a clear path to reproduction with a code example. The best way to show
a bug is by sending a minimal reproduction as a GitHub repo, CodeSandbox, or StackBlitz.

You may wish to use this starter template to help you get going: https://github.com/astahmer/panda-vite-template

## Proposing new or changed API?

Please provide thoughtful comments and some sample API code. Proposals that don't line up with our roadmap or don't have
a thoughtful explanation will be closed. You can check the existing proposals and our official roadmap here:
https://panda-css.canny.io/

## Making a Pull Request?

Pull requests need only the :+1: of two or more collaborators to be merged; when the PR author is a collaborator, that
counts as one.

### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with the commit conventions used in this
repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention `category(scope or module): message` in your commit
message while using one of the following categories:

- `feat / feature`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for usage of a lib or cli usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `test`: all changes regarding tests (adding new tests or changing existing ones)
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e. github actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above categories

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ or check out the
[Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

### Steps to PR

1. Fork of the panda repository and clone your fork

2. Create a new branch out of the `main` branch. We follow the convention `[type/scope]`. For example
   `fix/accordion-hook` or `docs/menu-typo`. `type` can be either `docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `build`, or any other
   conventional commit type. `scope` is just a short id that describes the scope of work.

3. Make and commit your changes following the
   [commit convention](https://github.com/chakra-ui/panda/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-convention). As you develop,
   you can run `pnpm pkg <module> build` and `pnpm pkg <module> test` to make sure everything works as expected. Please
   note that you might have to run `pnpm boot` first in order to build all dependencies.

4. Run `pnpm changeset` to create a detailed description of your changes. This will be used to generate a changelog when
   we publish an update. [Learn more about Changeset](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/tree/master/packages/cli).
   Please note that you might have to run `git fetch origin main:master` (where origin will be your fork on GitHub)
   before `pnpm changeset` works.
5. Also, if you provide `jsx` snippets to the changeset, please turn off the live preview by doing the following at the
   beginning of the snippet: ` ```jsx live=false`

> If you made minor changes like CI config, prettier, etc, you can run `pnpm changeset add --empty` to generate an empty
> changeset file to document your changes.

### Tests

All commits that fix bugs or add features need a test.

## Want to write a blog post or tutorial

That would be amazing! Reach out to the core team here: https://discord.gg/VQrkpsgSx7. We would love to support you any
way we can.

## Want to help improve the docs?

Our docsite lives in the [monorepo](./website/pages/docs/).
