# Style props

Style props lets you quickly build UI components in JSX by passing css properties as "props" to your components.

In the past, this had a lot of runtime implications but with Panda, all style props are statically analyzed and compiled
to CSS.

> Note: There's a feather weight runtime that handles splitting style props from native DOM attributes.

Although, you can get very far with just using the `className` prop, style props are a great way to quickly build UI
components in JSX.

```jsx
// The className approach

const Button = ({ children }) => (
  <button className={css({ bg: 'blue.500', color: 'white', py: '2', px: '4', rounded: 'md' })}>{children}</button>
)
```

```jsx
// The style props approach

const Button = ({ children }) => (
  <panda.button bg="blue.500" color="white" py="2" px="4" rounded="md">
    {children}
  </panda.button>
)
```

If you're used to Chakra UI, Styled System, or Vanilla Extract, you'll feel right at home with style props.

## Configuring JSX

Panda doesn't come with any JSX runtime by default. It supports JSX for React, Solid.js, Preact and Vue 3.

To enable JSX support, add the following options to your `panda.config.js` file.

- `jsxFactory` - The name of the JSX factory that generates supercharged elements like `panda.div`. Defaults to `panda`
- `jsxFramework` - The name of the JSX framework you're using. Defaults to `react`. Other options are `solid`, `preact`
  and `vue`

```js
{
    jsxFactory: 'panda',
    jsxFramework: 'react'
}
```

Next, you need to run `panda codegen` to generate the JSX runtime for your framework.

```bash
panda codegen --clean
```

That's it! You can now use JSX style props in your components.

## Using style props

Style props are just CSS properties that you can pass to your components as props. With the JSX runtime, you can use
`panda.<element>` syntax to create supercharged JSX elements that support style props.

```jsx title="src/components/button.jsx"
import { panda } from '../panda/jsx'

const Button = ({ children }) => (
  <panda.button bg="blue.500" color="white" py="2" px="4" rounded="md">
    {children}
  </panda.button>
)
```

## Patterns

All the patterns provided by Panda are available as JSX components.

```jsx
import { Stack } from '../panda/jsx'

const App = () => (
  <Stack gap="4">
    <button>Button</button>
    <button>Button</button>
    <button>Button</button>
  </Stack>
)
```

## Caveats

We don't support dynamic style props. This is a limitation of the current implementation.
