# Conditional Styles

Conditional styles are styles that change based on media query, selector or at-rule. They can be changed by providing
nested objects or modifying the property to use a conditional object.

Here's an example of how to modify a property using nested objects.

```js
css({
  color: 'red',
  // change the color based on "sm" breakpoint
  sm: {
    color: 'pink',
  },
})
```

Here's an example of how to modify a property using a conditional object.

```js
css({
  color: { base: 'red', sm: 'pink' },
})
```

Looks pretty similar, right? The difference is that the inline conditional object approach gives a more flexibility.

```js
css({
  color: { base: 'red', _hover: 'pink', _active: 'blue' },
})
```

Conditions can be nested as well.

```js
css({
  fontSize: {
    base: { _ltr: '16px', _rtl: '18px' },
    md: { _ltr: '18px', _rtl: '20px' },
  },
})
```
