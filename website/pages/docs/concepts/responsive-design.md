# Responsive Design

Responsive design is a fundamental aspect of modern web development, allowing websites and applications to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

Panda provides a comprehensive set of responsive utilities and features to facilitate the creation of responsive layouts. It lets you do this through conditional styles for different breakpoints. Let's say you want to change the font weight of a text on large screens, you can do it like this:

```jsx
<span
  className={css({
    fontWeight: 'medium',
    lg: { fontWeight: 'bold' }
  })}
>
  Text
</span>
```

> We use the `@media(min-width)` media query to ensure your interfaces are mobile-first.

The responsive syntax in Panda relies on the breakpoints that are defined in the Panda config file. Panda provides default breakpoints, which are shown below:

```ts
const breakpoints = {
  sm: '640px',
  md: '768px',
  lg: '1024px',
  xl: '1280px',
  '2xl': '1536px'
}
```

## Overview

### Property based styles

The initial example is effective, but it may be a bit wordy. You can apply the responsive condition directly to the `fontWeight` property, resulting in a more concise syntax:

```diff
<span
  className={css({
-   fontWeight: 'medium',
-   lg: { fontWeight: 'bold' }
+   fontWeight: { base: 'medium', lg: 'bold' }
  })}
>
  Text
</span>
```

### Nested styles

You can apply multiple conditions within your responsive conditions.

Let's say you want the text to have a different `fontWeight` when hovered, but only on large screens. You can do it like this:

```jsx
<span
  className={css({
    fontWeight: { base: 'medium', lg: { base: 'bold', _hover: 'extrabold' } }
  })}
>
  Text
</span>
```

### Targeting a breakpoint range

By default, styles assigned to a specific breakpoint will be effective at that breakpoint and will persist as applied styles at larger breakpoints.

If you wish to apply a utility exclusively when a particular range of breakpoints is active, Panda offers properties that restrict the style to that specific range. To construct the property, combine the minimum and maximum breakpoints using the "To" notation in camelCase format.

Let's say we want to apply styles between the `md` and `xl` breakpoints, we use the `mdToXl` property:

```jsx
<span
  className={css({
    fontWeight: { mdToXl: 'bold' }
  })}
>
  Text
</span>
```

> This text will only be bold in `md`, `lg` and `xl` breakpoints.

### Targeting a single breakpoint

To target a single breakpoint, you can easily achieve this by simply adding the suffix "Only" to the breakpoint name in camelCase format.

Let's say we want to apply styles only in the `lg` breakpoint, we use the `lgOnly` property:

```jsx
<span
  className={css({
    fontWeight: { lgOnly: 'bold' }
  })}
>
  Text
</span>
```

### Customizing Breakpoints

When encountering certain scenarios, it may become necessary to establish custom breakpoints tailored to your application's needs. It is advisable to utilize commonly used aliases such as `sm`, `md`, `lg`, and `xl` for this purpose.

In order to define custom breakpoints, you can easily accomplish this by passing them as an object within your Panda config.

> Note: Make sure that the CSS units of your breakpoints are consistent. Use either all pixels (`px`) or all `em`, but do not mix them.

```js filename="panda.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      breakpoints: {
        sm: '640px',
        md: '768px',
        lg: '1024px',
        xl: '1280px',
        '2xl': '1536px'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Hiding elements by breakpoint

If you need to limit the visibility of an element to any breakpoint, Panda provides [display utilities](/docs/utilities/display) to help you achieve this.
