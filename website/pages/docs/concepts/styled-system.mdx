# styled-system

## What is it?

While Panda generates your CSS at **build-time** using static extraction, we still need a lightweight runtime to transform the CSS-in-JS syntax (either [`object`](/docs/concepts/writing-styles#atomic-styles) or [`template-literal`](/docs/concepts/template-literals)) to class names strings. This is where the `styled-system` folder comes in.

When running the `panda` or `panda codegen` commands, the [`config.outdir`](/docs/references/config#outdir) will be used as output path to generate the `styled-system` in.

This is the core of what the `styled-system` does:

```ts
css({ color: 'blue.300' }) // => "text_blue_300"
```

Since Panda doesn't rely on any bundler's (`vite`, `webpack`, etc) plugin, there is no code transformation happening to convert the CSS-in-JS syntax to class names at compile-time.
This is why we need a lightweight runtime to do that.

The same principles applies to `patterns`, `recipes` and even `jsx` components, as they all use the `css` function under the hood.

If you look inside your `styled-system` folder, you should see the main entrypoints for the runtime:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="styled-system" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="css" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="jsx" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="recipes" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="patterns" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="tokens" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="types" />
    <FileTree.File name="styles.css" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Feel free to explore the files inside the `styled-system` folder to get a better understanding of how it works in details!

> Note: The `styled-system` folder is not meant to be edited manually. It is generated by Panda and should be treated as a build artifact.
> This also means you don't need to commit it to your repository.

## How does it work?

When running the `panda` command or with the postcss plugin, here's what's happening under the hood:

1. **Load Panda context**:
  - Find and evaluate app config, merge result with presets.
  - Create panda context: prepare code generator from config, parse user's file as AST.
2. **Generating artifacts**:
  - Write lightweight JS runtime and types to output directory
3. **Extracting used styles in app code**:
  - Run parser on each user's file: identify and extract styles, compute CSS, write to styles.css.

That `2. Generating artifacts` step is where the `styled-system` folder is generated, using the resolved config that contains all your tokens, patterns, recipes, utilities etc.
We generate a tailored runtime for your app, so that it only contains enough code (and types!) to support the styles you're using.

## Pre-rendering

If you use some way to pre-render your components to static HTML, for example using Astro or RSC, the `styled-system` functions like `css` and others will be removed at build-time and replaced by the generated class names, so that you don't have to ship the runtime to your users.
