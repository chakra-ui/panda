# Using Storybook

Easily use Panda with Gatsby with our dedicated integration.

<Steps>

### Create Gatsby project

To get started, we will need to create a new Gatsby project.
We will name our project `test-app` but you can name it whatever you want.

If you don't enter any parameter, the CLI will guide you through the process of creating a new Gatsby app.

```bash
npm init gatsby
```

> **Note:** If you want to use Gatsby with pnpm use install plugin [gatsby-plugin-pnpm](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-pnpm/).

You will be asked a few questions, answer them as follows:

```
‚úî What would you like to call your site? ... My Gatsby Site
‚úî What would you like to name the folder where your site will be created? ... projects/ test-app
‚úî Will you be using JavaScript or TypeScript? ... TypeScript
‚úî Will you be using a CMS? ... No (or I'll add it later)
‚úî Would you like to install a styling system? ... No (or I'll add it later)
‚úî Would you like to install additional features with other plugins? ... No items were selected
```

Enter the newly created directory:

```bash
cd test-app
```

### Install Panda CSS

Install Panda CSS and `gatsby-plugin-postcss` to your project.
After that run the `panda init` command to setup Panda CSS in your project.

```bash
npm install @pandacss/dev postcss gatsby-plugin-postcss
npx panda init --postcss
```

### Setup the Gatsby PostCSS plugin

Include the plugin in your `gatsby-config.ts` file. Check out the [official documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-postcss/) for more information.

```ts {12} filename="gatsby-config.ts"
import type { GatsbyConfig } from "gatsby"

const config: GatsbyConfig = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `My Gatsby Site`,
    siteUrl: `https://www.yourdomain.tld`,
  },
  // More easily incorporate content into your pages through automatic TypeScript type generation and better GraphQL IntelliSense.
  // If you use VSCode you can also use the GraphQL plugin
  // Learn more at: https://gatsby.dev/graphql-typegen
  graphqlTypegen: true,
  plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-postcss`],
}

export default config
```

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff {3} filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "develop": "gatsby develop",
    "start": "gatsby develop",
    "build": "gatsby build",
    "serve": "gatsby serve",
    "clean": "gatsby clean",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit"
  }
}
```
- `"prepare"` - script that will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

### Configure the content

Make sure that all of the paths of your React components are included in the `include` section of the `panda.config.ts` file.

```js {8} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@pandacss/dev"

export default defineConfig({
 // Whether to use css reset
 preflight: true,

 // Where to look for your css declarations
 include: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"],

 // Files to exclude
 exclude: [],

 // The output directory for your css system
 outdir: "styled-system",
})
```

### Configure the entry CSS with layers

Create `src/styles/index.css` file and add the following content:

```css filename="src/styles/index.css"
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

### Import the entry CSS

Create a `gatsby-browser.ts` file in the root of your project and add the following content:

```ts filename="gatsby-browser.ts"
import './src/styles/index.css'
```

### Start your build process

Run the following command to start your development server.

```bash
npm run develop
```

### Start using Panda

Now you can start using Panda CSS in your project.
Here is the snippet of code that you can use in your `src/pages/index.tsx` file.

```tsx {3, 7} filename="src/pages/index.tsx"
import * as React from "react"
import type { HeadFC, PageProps } from "gatsby"
import { css } from "../../styled-system/css"

const IndexPage: React.FC<PageProps> = () => {
  return (
    <div className={css({ fontSize: "2xl", fontWeight: 'bold' })}>Hello üêº!</div>
  )
}

export default IndexPage

export const Head: HeadFC = () => <title>Home Page</title>
```
</Steps>
