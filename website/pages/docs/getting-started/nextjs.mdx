# Using Panda CSS with Next.js

Panda CSS works out of the box with Next.js. You can use Panda CSS with Next.js by following the steps below.

If you don't have Next.js app installed, you can follow the [Create a Next.js app](#create-a-nextjs-app) section to create a new Next.js app, otherwise you can skip to the [Install Panda CSS](#install-panda-css) section.

<RouteSwitch values={["app-dir","pages-dir"]}>

  ## Start a new project

  You can chose between these two options to start a new project:

  <RouteSwitchTrigger values={["Using App Router", "Using Pages Router"]} />

  <Steps>
  ### Create a Next.js app

  First, create a Next.js app using the official [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) CLI.
  We will name our project `test-app` but you can name it whatever you want.

  If you don't enter any parameter, the CLI will guide you through the process of creating a new Next.js app.

  <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      pnpm dlx create-next-app@latest --use-pnpm
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      npx create-next-app@latest --use-npm
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      yarn dlx create-next-app@latest --use-yarn
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  You will be asked a few questions, answer them as follows:

  <RouteSwitchContent value="app-dir">
    ```bash
    ‚úî What is your project named? ‚Ä¶ test-app
    ‚úî Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? ‚Ä¶ Yes
    ‚úî Would you like to use ESLint with this project? ‚Ä¶ Yes
    ‚úî Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? ‚Ä¶ No
    ‚úî Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? ‚Ä¶ Yes
    ‚úî Use App Router (recommended)? ‚Ä¶ Yes
    ‚úî Would you like to customize the default import alias? ‚Ä¶ No
    ```
  </RouteSwitchContent>
  <RouteSwitchContent value="pages-dir">
    ```bash
    ‚úî What is your project named? ‚Ä¶ test-app
    ‚úî Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? ‚Ä¶ Yes
    ‚úî Would you like to use ESLint with this project? ‚Ä¶ Yes
    ‚úî Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? ‚Ä¶ No
    ‚úî Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? ‚Ä¶ Yes
    ‚úî Use App Router (recommended)? ‚Ä¶ No
    ‚úî Would you like to customize the default import alias? ‚Ä¶ No
    ```
  </RouteSwitchContent>

  Enter the newly created directory:
  ```bash
  cd test-app
  ```

  ### Install Panda CSS

  Install Panda CSS dependency using your favorite package manager.

  <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      pnpm install -D @pandacss/dev
      pnpm panda init --postcss
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      npm install -D @pandacss/dev
      npx panda init --postcss
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      yarn add -D @pandacss/dev
      yarn panda init --postcss
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  `panda init --postcss` command will automatically create a `postcss.config.js` file at the root of your project with the following code:

  ```js {3}
  module.exports = {
    plugins: {
      '@pandacss/dev/postcss': {},
    },
  }
  ```

  For advanced configuration follow the Next.js PostCSS guide to set up a custom PostCSS configuration by referring to this [link](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/post-css#customizing-plugins).

  ### Update package.json scripts

  Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

  ```diff {3}
  {
    "scripts": {
  +    "prepare": "panda codegen",
      "dev": "next dev",
      "build": "next build",
      "start": "next start",
      "lint": "next lint"
    }
  }
  ```

  The `prepare` script that will run codegen after dependency installation. Read more about [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

  ### Configure the entry CSS with layers

  <RouteSwitchContent value="app-dir">
    In your Next.js project, navigate to the `src/app` folder and open `global.css` file. Replace all the content with the following code:
  </RouteSwitchContent>
  <RouteSwitchContent value="pages-dir">
    In your Next.js project, navigate to the `src/styles` folder and open `globals.css` file. Replace all the content with the following code:
  </RouteSwitchContent>

  ```css
     @layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
  ```

  <RouteSwitchContent value="app-dir">
    > **Note:** Feel free to remove the `page.module.css` file as we don't need it anymore.
  </RouteSwitchContent>
  <RouteSwitchContent value="pages-dir">
    > **Note:** Feel free to remove the `Home.module.css` file as we don't need it anymore.
  </RouteSwitchContent>


  ### Start using Panda

  <RouteSwitchContent value="app-dir">
    We will update the contents of `src/app/page.tsx` with the following snippet that uses Panda CSS:
  </RouteSwitchContent>
  <RouteSwitchContent value="pages-dir">
    We will update the contents of `src/pages/index.tsx` with the following snippet that uses Panda CSS:
  </RouteSwitchContent>

  ```tsx
    import { css } from '../../styled-system/css';

    export default function Home() {
      return (
        <div className={css({ fontSize: "2xl", fontWeight: 'bold' })}>Hello üêº!</div>
      )
    }
    ```

  ### Start the development server

  Run the following command to start the development server:

  <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      pnpm dev
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```bash
      yarn dev
      ```
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

  </Steps>
</RouteSwitch>

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes Next.js caches PostCSS generated styles and you need to clear the cache. To do that, delete the `.next` folder and restart your development server.

You can also update you `package.json` scripts to delete the `.next` folder before each build:

```diff {3,4}
{
  "scripts": {
-    "dev": "next dev",
+    "dev": "rm -rf .next && next dev",
  },
}
```
