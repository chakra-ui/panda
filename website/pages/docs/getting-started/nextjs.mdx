# Using Panda CSS with Next.js

Panda CSS works out of the box with Next.js. You can use Panda CSS with Next.js by following the steps below.

If you don't have Next.js app installed, you can follow the [Create a Next.js app](#create-a-nextjs-app) section to create a new Next.js app, otherwise you can skip to the [Install Panda CSS](#install-panda-css) section.

## Start a new project

<Steps>
### Create a Next.js app

First, create a Next.js app using the official [Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) CLI.
We will name our project `test-app` but you can name it whatever you want.

If you don't enter any parameter, the CLI will guide you through the process of creating a new Next.js app.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest --use-pnpm
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest --use-npm
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest --use-yarn
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You will be asked a few questions, answer them as follows:
```bash
✔ What is your project named? … test-app
✔ Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use ESLint with this project? … Yes
✔ Would you like to use Tailwind CSS with this project? … No
✔ Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? … Yes
✔ Use App Router (recommended)? … Yes
✔ Would you like to customize the default import alias? … No
```

Enter the newly created directory:
```bash
cd test-app
```

### Install Panda CSS

Install Panda CSS dependency using your favorite package manager.

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm install @pandacss/dev
    pnpm panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install @pandacss/dev
    npx panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn install @pandacss/dev
    yarn panda init --postcss
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Update package.json scripts

Open your `package.json` file and update the `scripts` section as follows:

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
+    "prepare": "panda codegen",
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```
- `"prepare"` - script that will run Panda CSS CLI codegen before each build. Read more about [codegen](/docs/references/cli#panda-codegen) in the CLI section.

### Add panda CSS styles to your app layout

In your Next.js project, navigate to the `src/app` folder and open `global.css` file. Replace all the content with the following code:

```css
@layer reset, base, tokens, recipes, utilities;
```

### PostCSS config

`panda init -p` command will automatically create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your project with the following code:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    '@pandacss/dev/postcss': {},
  },
}
```

For advanced configuration follow the Next.js PostCSS guide to set up a custom PostCSS configuration by referring to this [link](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/post-css#customizing-plugins).

### Start using Panda

We will update the contents of `page.tsx` with the following snippet that uses Panda CSS:

```tsx
import { css } from '../../styled-system/css';

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className={css({ fontSize: "2xl", fontWeight: 'bold' })}>Hello 🐼!</div>
  )
}
```

> **Note:** You can also remove `page.module.css` file as we don't need it anymore.

### Start the development server

Run the following command to start the development server:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes Next.js caches PostCSS generated styles and you need to clear the cache. To do that, delete the `.next` folder and restart your development server.

You can also update you `package.json` scripts to delete the `.next` folder before each build:

```diff
{
  "scripts": {
-    "dev": "next dev",
+    "dev": "rm -rf .next && next dev",
  },
}
```
