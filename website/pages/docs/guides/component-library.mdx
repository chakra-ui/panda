# Using Panda in a Component Library

When creating a component library that uses Panda which can be used in a variety of different projects, you have four options:

1. Ship a Panda [preset](/docs/customization/presets)
2. Ship a static CSS file
3. Use Panda as external package, and ship the src files
4. Use Panda as external package, and ship the build info file

> In the examples below, we use `tsup` as the build tool. You can use any other build tool.

## Ship a Panda Preset

This is the simplest approach. You can include the token, semantic tokens, text styles, etc. within a preset and consume them in your projects.

**Library code**

```tsx filename="src/index.ts"
import { definePreset } from '@pandacss/dev'

export const acmePreset = definePreset({
  theme: {
    extend: {
      tokens: {
        colors: { primary: 'blue.500' }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Build the preset code

```bash
pnpm tsup src/index.ts
```

**App code**

```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { acmePreset } from '@acme-org/panda-preset'
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  presets: ['@pandacss/dev/presets', acmePreset]
})
```

> Adding a preset will remove the default theme from Panda. To add it back, you need to include the `@pandacss/dev/presets` preset.

## Ship a Static CSS File

This approach involves extracting the static css of your library at build time. Then you can import the CSS file in your app code.

**Library code**

```tsx filename="src/index.tsx"
import { css } from '../styled-system/css'

export function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button type="button" className={css({ bg: 'red.300', px: '2', py: '3' })}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

Then you can build the library code and generate the static CSS file:

```bash
# build the library code
tsup src/index.tsx

# generate the static CSS file
panda cssgen --outfile dist/styles.css
```

This approach comes with a few downsides:

- You can't customize the styles since the css is already generated
- You might need add the [prefix](/docs/references/config#prefix) option to avoid className conflicts

  ```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
  import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

  export default defineConfig({
    //...
    prefix: 'acme'
  })
  ```

- You might have duplicate CSS classes when using multiple atomic css libraries

## Use Panda as external package

### Include the src files

**Library code**

Include the `src` directory of your library in the package.json `files` field:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "name": "@acme-org/design-system",
  "files": ["src", "dist"]
}
```

Convert the `styled-system` directory to a package by setting the `emitPackage` and `outdir` properties. This will inform Panda to emit the code artifacts to the `node_modules`.

```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  emitPackage: true,
  outdir: '@acme-org/styled-system'
})
```

Next, you need to run the `panda codegen` command. Going forward, you'll now import the functions from the `@acme-org/styled-system` package.

```tsx
import { css } from '@acme-org/styled-system/css'

export function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button type="button" className={css({ bg: 'red.300', px: '2', py: '3' })}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

Mark the `@acme-org/styled-system` as an external package in your library build tool.

```bash
tsup src/index.tsx --external @acme-org/styled-system
```

**App code**

Set the `emitPackage` and `outdir` properties in your app config file to match the library config file.

```tsx {5,6} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  emitPackage: true,
  outdir: '@acme-org/styled-system'
})
```

This will inform Panda to emit the code artifacts to the `node_modules`, and create a symlink for the library code. It will also avoid duplicating the runtime JS code.

Include the `src` directory from the library code in the panda config.

```tsx {6} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  include: [
    './node_modules/@acme-org/design-system/src/**/*.tsx',
    './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'
  ],
  emitPackage: true,
  outdir: '@acme-org/styled-system'
})
```

### Ship the build info file

This approach is similar to the previous one, but instead of shipping the source code, you ship the Panda build info file. This will have **the exact same end-result** as adding the sources files in the `include`, but it will allow you not to ship the source code.

The build info file is a JSON file that **only** contains the information about the static extraction result, you still need to ship your app build/dist by yourself. It can be used by Panda to generate CSS classes without the need for parsing the source code.

Convert the `styled-system` directory to a package by setting the `emitPackage` and `outdir` properties. This will inform Panda to emit the code artifacts to the `node_modules`.

```tsx filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  emitPackage: true,
  outdir: '@acme-org/styled-system'
})
```

Next, you need to run the `panda codegen` command. Going forward, you'll now import the functions from the `@acme-org/styled-system` package.

```tsx
import { css } from '@acme-org/styled-system/css'

export function Button({ children }) {
  return (
    <button type="button" className={css({ bg: 'red.300', px: '2', py: '3' })}>
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```

Mark the `@acme-org/styled-system` as an external package in your library build tool.

```bash
tsup src/index.tsx --external @acme-org/styled-system
```

Generate the build info file:

```bash
panda ship --outfile dist/panda.buildinfo.json
```

**App code**

Set the `emitPackage` and `outdir` properties in your app config file to match the library config file.

```tsx {5,6} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  emitPackage: true,
  outdir: '@acme-org/styled-system'
})
```

This will inform Panda to emit the code artifacts to the `node_modules`, and create a symlink for the library code. It will avoid duplicating the runtime code.

Next, you need to include the build info file from the library code in the panda config.

```tsx {6} filename="panda.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from '@pandacss/dev'

export default defineConfig({
  //...
  include: [
    './node_modules/@acme-org/design-system/dist/panda.buildinfo.json',
    './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'
  ],
  emitPackage: true,
  outdir: '@acme-org/styled-system'
})
```

## Recommendations

- Library Code shouldn't be published on npm and App code uses Panda, use [ship build info](#ship-the-build-info-file) approach
- App code might not use Panda, use the [static css](#ship-a-static-css-file) file approach
- App code lives in an internal monorepo, use the [include src files](#include-the-src-files) approach
- Library code doesn't ship components but only ships tokens, patterns or recipes, use the [ship preset](#ship-a-panda-preset) approach

> ⚠️ If you use the `include src files` or `ship build info` approach, you might also need to ship a `preset` if your library code has any custom tokens, patterns or recipes.

## Troubleshooting

- When using `tsup` or any other build tool for your component library, if you run into a module resolution error that looks similar to `ERROR: Could not resolve "../styled-system/xxx"`. Consider setting the `outExtension`in the panda config to`js`

- If you use Yarn PnP, you might need to set the `nodeLinker: node-modules` in the `.yarnrc.yml` file.
