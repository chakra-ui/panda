# Get started with Panda

Panda is a styling engine that generates styling primitives to author atomic CSS and recipes in a type-safe and readable manner.

Panda combines the developer experience of CSS-in-JS and the performance of atomic CSS. It leverages static analysis to scan your JavaScript and TypeScript files for JSX style props and function calls, generating styles on-demand (aka Just-in-Time)

> TLDR; Panda is a CSS-in-JS engine that generates atomic CSS at build time (via CLI or PostCSS)
