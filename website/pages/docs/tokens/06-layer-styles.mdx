# Text Styles

Layer styles provide a way to create consistent and visually appealing elements. By defining a set of properties and effects, you can easily apply them to various design elements, ensuring visual coherence throughout your design system.

Text styles allows you to define visual css properties and effects. The common peoperties are:

- Color or text color
- Background color
- Border width and border color
- Box shadow
- Opacity

Layer styles are defined in the `layerStyles` property of the tokens.

Here's an example of a text style:

```js
const tokens = {
  layerStyles: {
    container: {
      description: 'container styles',
      value: {
        bg: 'gray.50',
        border: '2px solid',
        borderColor: 'gray.500'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Good to know:** The `value` property maps to style objects that will be applied to the element.

## Usage
Now we can use `layerStyle` property in our components.

```jsx
function App() {
  return <div className={css({ layerStyle: 'container' })} />
}
```
