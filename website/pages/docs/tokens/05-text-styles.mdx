# Text Styles

Typography forms the core of any interface design, making it important to establish patterns for consistent, legible
typography early in the development process. It'll also help you avoid duplicating typography properties.

Text styles allows you to define textual css properties. The common peoperties are:

- The font family, weight, size
- Line height
- Letter spacing
- Text Decoration (strikethrough and underline)
- Text Transform (uppercase, lowercase, and capitalization)

Text styles are defined in the `textStyles` property of the tokens.

Here's an example of a text style:

```js
const tokens = {
  textStyles: {
    body: {
      $description: 'The body text style - used in paragraphs',
      value: {
        fontFamily: 'Inter',
        fontWeight: '500',
        fontSize: '16',
        lineHeight: '24',
        letterSpacing: '0',
        textDecoration: 'None',
        textTransform: 'None',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

> **Good to know:** The `value` property maps to style objects that will be applied to the text.

## Best Practices

To ensure the consistency of your design system, it's important to avoid adding layout properties (margin, padding,
etc.) or color properties (background, colors, etc.) to the text styles.
