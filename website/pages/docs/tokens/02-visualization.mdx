# Token Visualization

Panda provide built-in documentation for tokens defined in your project. This will be useful for your team to
communicate design decisions in your own way, and share information effectively.

> **Good to know:** The Panda Studio is a React application built with Astro

To launch the Panda studio, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm panda studio
```

This will launch a local server on port 3000. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/tokens` to view the documentation.

## Deployment

To build the Panda Studio, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm panda studio --build
```

This will create a `panda-static` folder in the root of your project. You can deploy this folder to any static site host
like Vercel or Netlify.
