## What is LLMs.txt?

[LLMs.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files are used to provide the Panda CSS documentation to large language models (LLMs).
This helps AI tools better understand our styling engine, its APIs, and usage patterns.

## Available Routes

These routes are available to help AI tools access our documentation:

- [/llms.txt](/llms.txt) - Contains a structured overview of all concepts and their documentation links
- [/llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) - Provides comprehensive documentation including implementation details and examples

## Access Individual Pages

You can also access the raw markdown content for any documentation page by adding `.mdx` to the end of the URL. For
example:

- [`/docs/overview/getting-started.mdx`](/docs/overview/getting-started.mdx) - Raw markdown for the getting started page
- [`/docs/concepts/recipes.mdx`](/docs/concepts/recipes.mdx) - Raw markdown for the recipes documentation
- [`/docs/theming/tokens.mdx`](/docs/theming/tokens.mdx) - Raw markdown for the tokens documentation

This is useful for AI tools that need to access specific documentation sections directly.

## Usage with AI Tools
