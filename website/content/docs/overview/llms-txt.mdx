# LLMs.txt

## What is LLMs.txt?

We support [LLMs.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) files for making the Panda CSS documentation available to large language
models (LLMs). This feature helps AI tools better understand our styling engine, its APIs, and usage patterns.

## Available Routes

We provide several LLMs.txt routes to help AI tools access our documentation:

- [/llms.txt](/llms.txt) - Contains a structured overview of all concepts and their documentation links
- [/llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) - Provides comprehensive documentation including implementation details and examples

## Access Individual Pages

You can also access the raw markdown content for any documentation page by adding `.mdx` to the end of the URL. For
example:

- [`/docs/overview/getting-started.mdx`](/docs/overview/getting-started.mdx) - Raw markdown for the getting started page
- [`/docs/concepts/recipes.mdx`](/docs/concepts/recipes.mdx) - Raw markdown for the recipes documentation
- [`/docs/theming/tokens.mdx`](/docs/theming/tokens.mdx) - Raw markdown for the tokens documentation

This is useful for AI tools that need to access specific documentation sections directly.

## Usage with AI Tools

### Cursor

Use the `@Docs` feature in Cursor to include the LLMs.txt files in your project. This helps Cursor provide more accurate
code suggestions and documentation for Panda CSS.

CSS.
