### Panda Studio

Panda Studio is a visual interface for exploring and understanding your entire design system. It provides a read-only
view of your tokens, semantic tokens, recipes, patterns, conditions, and more.

If you don't want to manually generate spec files or build a documentation website, Panda Studio is the easiest option.

- Studio does not require you to run pnpm panda spec.

- Studio generates and visualizes your design system automatically.

- Studio acts as a fully-featured documentation tool without writing any documentation code.

> Spec files are primarily for custom documentation setups and Storybook integrations. Panda Studio is for teams who
> want instant documentation.

## Panda Studio Setup

To use panda studio, first install it:

```bash
pnpm i @pandacss/studio
```

Next, launch it locally using:

```bash
pnpm panda studio
```

This starts a local server and launches an interactive dashboard showing all your design system elements. Since Studio
reads your theme configuration directly, any changes to your `panda.config.ts` will appear automatically the next time
you run it.

You can also deploy the studio as a standalone design system portal for your team.
